=================
Running the game:
=================
On Unix, navigate to the directory <root game folder>/src and execute
the run_program script.

Or, on Windows (with Dr. Java installed), just compile it with Dr. Java and run the Menu.java file.


============
How to play:
============
Each player's position is indicated by an icon around the edge of the game board (which shows a "1/2/3/4",
depending on the player).

Once the game's started, click the "Continue" button to execute one turn. During one turn, the player
whose name is highlighted in green will roll, move, and potentially buy properties/pay rent/etc. After
the player makes these moves, you can go straight to the next turn (click "Continue" again) or buy the
property you're currently standing on.

Rinse and repeat.
