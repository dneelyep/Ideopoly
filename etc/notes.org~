* TODO Setup version control (git?) for this project. Will probably be useful in some way.
* Monopoly? Better: Ideopoly
** Ideas
Pick a historical ideological figure and fight for supporters!
Choose from Margaret Thatcher[?] (Conservatism), Marx (Communism), Rand/Smith[?] (Capitalism), Stallman (Free culture), Gandhi[?] (non-violence), ? (environmentalism),
  Simone de Beauvoir[?] (feminism), Otto von Bismarck[?] (realpolitik), Adolf Hitler[?] (fascism)
Goal in regular monopoly is to be the richest and bankrupt the others. Here, the goal is to achieve total ideological domination, a la 1984. Everyone follows your views blindly. lols.

Currency is followers rather than money.
Rather than using different types of bills, we have different types of followers.
$1   - Individual peon
$5   - Individual peon involved in local groups
$10  - Community organizer
$20  - Academic
$50  - Favorable newspaper columnist
$100 - Glenn Beck
$500 - Fox Newspaper

Gain control of propaganda outlets rather than properties
So rather than paying for the outlets in terms of x peons for a propaganda outlet, think of it as you have to have so much support to get an outlet.
Rather than using rent, when an opponent passes through a propaganda outlet, you get to make an attack through that outlet on them. So they lose a few supporters.
Rather than using houses/hotels, require a certain number of Glenn Becks/Fox News's. That way attacks on the opponent will be more effective.

Chances/Community Chests are now Chances[TODO: ?] and Community Events
Getting one can give you a boost or penalty. IE: Rally in your party's name! Gain 20 peons and an academic!

A banker should not be neccessary. That aspect is automated through computation. Its only function in the real game is convenience for players to get/deposit money, etc.

Utilities: Scandalous tv show OR scandalous newspaper (weekly world news). If ya have either/both, there's a high variability in effectiveness of
           any given "episode" that calls out your opponents. But you can get big-time scoops by chance that will cost your opponents lots.
Railroads: Replaced by educational systems. Hard to change, critical infrastructure, like a railroad. As you gain control of more of them, the benefits of
           them multiply.
*** Community chests [or events]/Chances
**** TODO Check values of the original cards so I can get an idea of how much these should be worth in terms of cash/supporters.
**** "Your manifesto goes viral!" +50 Individual peons!
**** "Police brutality at a local rally you held!" -5 individual peons. +1 academic.
**** "Fanatic supporters damage your opponents' property! Each opponent loses 25 peons to the bank in the aftermath."
**** "Annual educational standards review decides to not support ideology. Go directly to nearest school and lose x number of supporters." See the actual card for this.

** Rules
Monopoly Rules
How to Play the game of Monopoly
Official rules to the original, classic Parker Brothers edition of the Monopoly Game.
*** Object
The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling
property.
*** Equipment
The equipment consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens, 32 houses and 12 hotels. There are Chance
and Community Chest cards, a Title Deed card for each property and play money.
*** Preparation
Place the board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards face down on
their allotted spaces on the board. Each player chooses one token to represent him/her while
traveling around the board.

Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6 $20's; 5
each of $10's, $5's and $1's. All remaining money and other equipment go to the Bank.
*** Banker
Select as Banker a player who will also make a good Auctioneer. A Banker who plays in the
game must keep his/her personal funds separate from those of the Bank. When more than five
persons play, the Banker may elect to act only as Banker and Auctioneer.
*** The Bank
Besides the Bank's money, the Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior
to purchase and use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions
properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells houses and hotels to the players
and loans money when required on mortgages. The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and
interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.
The Bank never "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker may issue as much
more as may be needed by writing on any ordinary paper.
*** The Play
Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. The player with the highest total
starts the play: Place your token on the corner marked "GO," throw the dice and move your
token in the direction of the arrow the number of spaces indicated by the dice. After you have
completed your play, the turn passes to the left. The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and
proceed from that point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same
space at the same time.

According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to buy real estate or other
properties or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to
Jail", etc. If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the two dice, and
are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which you land. Retaining
the dice, throw again and move your token as before. If you throw doubles three times in
succession, move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).
*** Go
Each time a player's token lands on or passes over GO, whether by throwing the dice or
drawing a card, the Banker pays him/her a $200 salary.
The $200 is paid only once each time around the board. However, if a player passing GO on
the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it on Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond it on
Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, he/she collects $200 for passing GO the first
time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.
*** Buying Property
Whenever you land on an unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its
printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership; place it face up in front of you.
If you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction to the highest bidder. The
buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that
property. Any player, including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price,
may bid. Bidding may start at any price.
*** Paying Rent
When you land on property owned by another player, the owner collects rent from you in
accordance with the list printed on its Title Deed card.
If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a property is mortgaged, its Title
Deed card is placed face down in front of the owner.
It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-group (e.g., Boardwalk and Park
Place; or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge
double rent for unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to unmortgaged
properties even if another property in that color-group is mortgaged.
It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much
higher than for unimproved properties. The owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask
for it before the second player following throws the dice.
*** "Chance" and "Community Chest"
When you land on either of these spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, follow the
instructions and return the card face down to the bottom of the deck.
The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck. If
the player who draws it does not wish to use it, he/she may sell it, at any time, to another player
at a price agreeable to both.
*** "Income Tax"
If you land here you have two options: You may estimate your tax at $200 and pay the Bank,
or you may pay 10% of your total worth to the Bank. Your total worth is all your cash on hand,
printed prices of mortgaged and unmortgaged properties and cost price of all buildings you own.
You must decide which option you will take before you add up your total worth.
*** "Jail"
You land in Jail when:
- your token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail";
- you draw a card marked "Go to Jail"; or
- you throw doubles three times in succession.
When you are sent to Jail you cannot collect your $200 salary in that move since, regardless of
where your token is on the board, you must move it directly into Jail. Yours turn ends when you
are sent to Jail. If you are not sent to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on that space,
you are "Just Visiting", you incur no penalty, and you move ahead in the usual manner on your
next turn.
You get out of Jail by:
- throwing doubles on any of your next three turns; if you succeed in doing this you
immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even
though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn;
- using the "Get Out of Jail Free" card if you have it;
- purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and playing it; (4) paying
a fine of $50 before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.
If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out of
Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw.
Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell property, buy and sell houses and hotels and
collect rents.
*** Free Parking
A player landing on this place does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This
is just a free resting place.
*** Houses
When you own all the properties in a color-group you may buy houses from the Bank and erect
them on those properties. If you buy one house, you may put it on any one of those properties.
The next house you buy must be erected on one of the unimproved properties of this or any
other complete color-group you may own.
The price you must pay the Bank for each house is shown on your Title Deed card for the
property on which you erect the house. The owner still collects double rent from an opponent
who lands on the unimproved properties of his/her complete color-group. Following the above
rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgment and financial
standing will allow. But you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on
any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on every property of that
group. You may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses
to a property. For example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have only one
house on another property of that group.
As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank (see
SELLING PROPERTY).
*** Hotels
When a player has four houses on each property of a complete color-group, he/she may buy
a hotel from the Bank and erect it on any property of the color-group. He/she returns the four
houses from that property to the Bank and pays the price for the hotel as shown on the Title
Deed card. Only one hotel may be erected on any one property.
*** Building Shortages
When the Bank has no houses to sell, players wishing to build must wait for some player to
return or sell his/her houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of houses
and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more than the Bank has, the houses
or hotels must be sold at auction to the highest bidder.
*** Selling Property
Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as
a private transaction for any amount the owner can get; however, no property can be sold to
another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-group. Any buildings
so located must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that colorgroup.
Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid
for them.

All houses on one color-group must be sold one by one, evenly, in reverse of the manner in
which they were erected. All hotels on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be
sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in reverse of the manner in
which they were erected.
*** Mortgages
Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the Bank at any time. Before an improved
property can be mortgaged, all the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold
back to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title Deed card.
No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, but rent can be collected on
unmortgaged properties in the same group. In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the
Bank the amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the properties of a color-group
are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy back houses at full price.
The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and no other player may secure
it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property
to another player at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage at
once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus 10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not
lifted at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when you buy the property and if you lift the
mortgage later you must pay the Bank an additional 10% interest as well as the amount of the
mortgage.
*** Bankruptcy
You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you can pay either to another player or to
the Bank. If your debt is to another player, you must turn over to that player all that you have
of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if you own houses or hotels, you
must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid
for them; this cash is given to the creditor. If you have mortgaged property you also turn this
property over to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay the Bank the amount of
interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property. The new owner who does this
may then, at his/her option, pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then lift
the mortgage. If he/she holds property in this way until a later turn, he/she must pay the interest
again upon lifting the mortgage.
Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you can pay (because of taxes
or penalties) even by selling off buildings and mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets
to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken, except
buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the
game wins.
*** Miscellaneous
Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property. No
player may borrow from or lend money to another player.
*** Rules for a Short Game (60 to 90 minutes)
There are five changed rules for this first Short Game.
- During PREPARATION, the Banker shuffles then deals three Title Deed cards to each
player. These are free no payment to the Bank is required.
- You need only three houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group
before you may buy a hotel. Hotel rent remains the same. The turn-in value is still onehalf
the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game.
- If you land in Jail you must exit on your next turn by
 - using a "Get Out of Jail Free" card if you have (or can buy) one; or
 - rolling doubles; or
 - paying $50. Unlike the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and, failing to
do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.
- The penalty for landing on "Income Tax" is a flat $200.
- END OF GAME: The game ends when one player goes bankrupt. The remaining players
value their property:
 - cash on hand;
 - lots, utilities and railroads owned, at the price printed on the board;
 - any mortgaged property owned, at one-half the price printed on the board;
 - houses, valued at purchase price;
 - hotels, valued at purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in.
The richest player wins!
*** Another Good Short Game
Time Limit Game
Before starting, agree upon a definite hour of termination, when the richest player will be
declared the winner. Before starting, the Banker shuffles and cuts the Title Deed cards and
deals two to each player. Players immediately pay the Bank the price of the properties dealt to
them
** Notes
*** TODO I could actually add all of the rules as tests and use that to drive my development. That way I could gradually see each feature progress.
*** TODO Should maybe include a "Quit" button in the game so the player can quit if desired.
*** A banker will not be neccessary. Would be pointless.
Besides the Bank's money, the Bank:
**** holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the players.
**** The Bank pays salaries and bonuses.
**** It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards.
**** it sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.
**** The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all properties which it sells and auctions.
**** The Bank never "goes broke." If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker may issue as much more as may be needed by writing on any ordinary paper.
**** All of these functions of the bank are due to physical limitations, etc. => Don't need a bank in my program.

The next house you buy must be erected on one of the unimproved properties of this or any
other complete color-group you may own.
The price you must pay the Bank for each house is shown on your Title Deed card for the
property on which you erect the house. The owner still collects double rent from an opponent
who lands on the unimproved properties of his/her complete color-group. Following the above
rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgment and financial
standing will allow. But you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on
any one property of any color-group until you have built one house on every property of that
group. You may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses
to a property. For example, you cannot build three houses on one property if you have only one
house on another property of that group.
As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank (see

The $200 is paid only once each time around the board. However, if a player passing GO on
the throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it on Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond it on
Chance, and draws the "Advance to GO" card, he/she collects $200 for passing GO the first
time and another $200 for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.

** Make sure that a person can only buy a hotel if they have each property in a color group, and each of those properties holds 4 houses.
** Make sure multiple hotels can't be erected on a property.
** Make sure the player can't mortgage an unsellable property (IE Go, free parking, jail, etc.) Check this for all relevant properties.

* TODO Implement a mechanism to allow players to sell each other get out of jail free cards
* Steps to complete this
** Make the gui.
Just get the GUI up and running so I can mess around with it.
*** Make images/decide if I'll need them for the GUI.
** Make the background logic.
Should take the most time I think.
** Connect the background logic to the GUI.
Shouldn't be as difficult, but LOTS of opportunity for unexpected issues to crop up.
